The credit UCI ML dataset can be found in:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/South+German+Credit
 
The data folder has two files:
 
1. “credit.data”: The raw data downloaded from the UCI.
2. “credit.xlsx”: Which is the same data contained in “credit.data” but transformed to an .xlsx file.
 

There is categorical data (some multivariate) and it is also a classification problem.

variable_names = [“status”, “credit duration”, “credit history”, “credit purpose”, “credit amount”, “savings”, “employment duration”, “installment rate”, “personal status”, “other debtors”, “residence length”, “property”, “age”, “other installment plans”, “housing”, “number credits”, “job quality”, “number of people liable”, “telephone”, “foreign worker”]
