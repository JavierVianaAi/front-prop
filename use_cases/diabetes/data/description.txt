This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.


The data folder has one file:
 
1. “pima-indians-diabetes.csv”: The raw data downloaded from the Kaggle.


The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable. 

Independent variables include:
The number of pregnancies the patient has had.
Glucose Level
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin Level
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Diabetes Pedigree
Age
