The credit UCI ML dataset can be found in:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bias+correction+of+numerical+prediction+model+temperature+forecast
 
The data folder has two files:
 
1. “temperature.csv”: The raw data downloaded from the UCI.
2. “temperature.xlsx”: Which is the same data contained in “temperature.csv” but transformed to an .xlsx file.
 

This is a double output problem.

Data Set Information:

This data is for the purpose of bias correction of next-day maximum and minimum air temperatures forecast of the LDAPS model operated by the Korea Meteorological Administration over Seoul, South Korea. This data consists of summer data from 2013 to 2017. The input data is largely composed of the LDAPS model's next-day forecast data, in-situ maximum and minimum temperatures of present-day, and geographic auxiliary variables. There are two outputs (i.e. next-day maximum and minimum air temperatures) in this data. Hindcast validation was conducted for the period from 2015 to 2017.
